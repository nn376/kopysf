      <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
      <p>The King of Prussia Youth Sports Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization providing comprehensive development programs for boys and girls of all ages, races and creeds. Its primary goal is to offer a life-long progression of amateur sports programs that promote good sportsmanship, good citizenship and a sense of self-worth in students.<br>
  
  The Foundation’s programs in basketball, volleyball and track & field, provide a positive environment and a sound foundation for the physical, mental and moral development of student athletes. Though athletic development and competition is the centerpiece of our organization, our programs are designed to grow the whole person.<br>
  
  To participate, you must be between 10 and 17 years of age. And because education is so important to your future, we ask that you maintain a B average in school.</p>

      <h3>PRO SPORTS LEAGUES CREATED NEW <br>STANDARDS AND RULES FOR YOUTH SPORTS</h3>
  <div class="columns_2">
    <div class="row">
      <p>The beauty of youth sports is that your 10 favorite stories of the year are likely deeply personal. When you become a parent, your favorite athlete becomes the child that you’re raising. That means the confidence, development and enjoyment your child hopefully receives from sports come in so many different forms.
        In some cases, this positive experience is even due to a fluke of nature. Who scores their first soccer goal of the season when the opposing goalie punts the ball off a teammate’s head, setting up an empty net as the ball rolls perfectly onto the striker’s foot? My 9-year-old son, that’s who.
        But Project Play’s top 10 youth sports stories of the year are about something different.<p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="columns_2">
    <div class="row">
      <p>They’re the stories we deem the most important for the largest number of children collectively around the country. They’re about systematic failures and policy improvements, new research and old scandals, emerging trends and longstanding truths.
  Our subjective list shows that progress is being made. And it’s a reminder that so many challenges remain for every child to have their own, positive top 10 stories. It’s been well-documented that women remain an untapped area to develop more trained youth coaches, who are typically hard to find. That trend continued downward in data released during 2018 by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association and shared with the Aspen Institute. Only 23 percent of adults who coached kids 14 and under in the past five years were female, according to data from 2017, the most recent year available. That’s down from 28 percent in 2016 and the lowest on record dating to 2012.</p>
